![SmartWatch Keyboard Example](example.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the SmartWatch Keyboard Project repository! This project was developed as part of the Master's thesis in Computer Science at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon, specifically for the discipline of Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) in 2020.

## Description

The SmartWatch Keyboard Project implements a novel SmartKeyboard concept using Processing 3. The primary focus of this project is to explore and enhance the interaction between users and smartwatches, particularly in the context of text input.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project include:

1. **Smartwatch Keyboard Implementation:** Develop a functional smartwatch keyboard concept.
2. **User Speed:** Prioritize user speed in text input interactions.
3. **Split QWERTY Layout:** Implement a split QWERTY keyboard layout for improved ergonomics.
4. **Predictive Text:** Integrate predictive text functionality to enhance typing efficiency.

## Features

- **Smartwatch Keyboard:** The project introduces an innovative smartwatch keyboard for efficient text input.
- **Split QWERTY Layout:** A user-friendly split QWERTY keyboard design to enhance user comfort.
- **Predictive Text:** Incorporates predictive text technology to expedite the typing process.

## How to Use

To experiment with and run the SmartWatch Keyboard Project:

1. Ensure you have the Processing application installed. You can download it [here](https://processing.org/download/), and we recommend using version 3.5.
2. Open the project folder in the Processing application.
3. Run the project using the "run" feature in the Processing environment.

Feel free to explore the project, interact with the SmartWatch Keyboard, and provide feedback on your experience!
